# UML2Code

Welcome to the UML2Code â€“ your go-to tool for turning UML sequence diagrams into actual code! ðŸš€

## Overview
This project leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo with vision to process UML sequence diagram images. The tool then generates code snippets in your preferred programming language, framework, and software architecture. Plus, it's now in an exciting beta phase, so you get to be a part of the journey!

## Features
- **Automated Code Generation**: Simply upload your UML sequence diagram image, and let the tool work its magic to generate code snippets.
- **Language, Framework, and Architecture Selection**: Customize the output code according to your preferences.
- **GPT-4 Turbo with Vision**: Powered by the latest [OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision), allowing image input for enhanced capabilities.
